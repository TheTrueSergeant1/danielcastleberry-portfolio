# Portfolio Website Overview

I am excited to share a detailed overview of my personal cybersecurity portfolio website.  
The site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator, and is designed to showcase my technical skills, projects, experience, and professional journey. Below, I outline the key features, structure, and functionality of the website.

## Website Structure

The website is divided into several main sections:

### 1. Hero Section
The hero section introduces me with a professional headshot, name, and tagline summarizing my experience and objectives.  
Call-to-action buttons allow visitors to download my resume or navigate to the contact page for direct inquiries.

**Features:**
- âœ… Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- âœ… Clear, concise introduction with visual emphasis  
- âœ… Easy access to resume and contact links

### 2. Featured Skills
This section highlights my core technical competencies in cybersecurity. Skills are displayed as interactive **pill-shaped tags**, emphasizing areas such as:

- Security Tools: InsightIDR, ZScaler, Mimecast  
- Digital Forensics  
- Threat Detection  
- Networking: CCNA knowledge  

**Design Highlights:**
- ðŸ’¡ Pill-shaped skill tags for visual clarity  
- ðŸ’¡ Responsive layout ensures readability across devices

### 3. Recent Write-ups
I maintain a blog-style section where I document recent projects, write-ups, and security research. Each post card includes a title, description, and publication date. This allows visitors to quickly scan recent activity.

**Example Posts:**
- *How to Build a Cybersecurity Homelab*  
- *Understanding SIEM Tools*

**Features:**
- âœ¨ Interactive hover effects to highlight posts

### 4. Terminal Feature
One of the unique interactive elements of the site is the embedded terminal.  
This terminal allows visitors to explore my portfolio in a **text-based interface**, providing an engaging and immersive experience.

**Key Features of the Terminal:**
- Access via a toggle button in the header  
- Commands implemented include:
  - `whoami` â€” Display my personal and professional info  
  - `ls` â€” List available sections or "files"  
  - `cat [filename]` â€” Show full content from sections such as About, Skills, Experience, Homelab, Certifications, Projects, and Blog  
  - `date` â€” Show current date and time  
  - `gui` â€” Return to the graphical interface  
  - `help` â€” Display a list of available commands  
  - `clear` â€” Clear the terminal screen

This terminal provides an **innovative way** for users to explore the website content while demonstrating interactivity and familiarity with command-line environments.
